# Welcome

Hi there! I'm Rashi King Abramson. I've struggled with finding mental health resources in Marin County and want to put them all in one place. If you know of a resource that I should add, email me: [roshkins@gmail.com](mailto:roshkins@gmail.com). You can also issue a pull request if you know what that is or what that means.

## Mental Health Board

The Marin Mental Health Board meets the second Tuesday of every month at [20 North San Pedro Road, San Rafael, California](https://www.google.com/maps/place/20+N+San+Pedro+Rd,+San+Rafael,+CA+94903/@37.9947628,-122.5310837,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808599da7918cee7:0xa75611ff744abf91!8m2!3d37.994795!4d-122.529061). I am currently chair. Please email me, [roshkins@gmail.com](mailto:roshkins@gmail.com), if you have any questions or concerns about when or where the board meets.

 The board is currently off for **August**. The next meeting will be: **September 12, 2017**. 
 
 See all of the boards meetings! You may have to click "Look for more" a few times. I update this myself, so it may be out of date, but it should usually be correct.

 The board is currently looking for new members! I encourage you to apply if you have ever used mental health services, you are a family member of someone going through mental health issues. I also would like to see mental health professionals, such as psychotherapists or psychiatrists, and interested members of the public, but these are not as much as a priority.

## BHRS Access Line [(888) 818-1115](tel:+18888181115)
This is the first step you should take if you need mental health services. If you have private insurance, Y=you may get services more quickly if you look at the back of your insurance card and call the 24/7 nurseline or similar that is listed. Otherwise, the Access Line can help you locate resources through your insurance and through the county. 

8am-5pm is when someone is available to pickup the phone immediately.
Answering service between 5pm to 8am, but there is always someone available to respond day or night. I got this information by calling the Access Line.


## Crisis Stabilization Unit [(415) 473-6666](tel:+14154736666)

This was formerly called Psychiatric Emergency Services. This is a physical location at Marin General. Use this if you are in crisis and need therapy or other support now. They can help over the phone or in person. From my own experience, this is better than showing up to the emergency room. 

## National Suicide Prevention Lifeline [(800) 273-8255](tel:+1800273-8255)

If you are feeling suicidal, they may be able to offer some help for this moment.

## Linea Nacional de Prevención del Suicidio [(888) 628-9454](tel:+18886289454)
Para aquellos que hablan español, estas personas pueden ser capaces de ayudar puede ser capaz de ofrecer alguna ayuda para este momento.
