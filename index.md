# Welcome

Hi there! I'm Rashi King Abramson. I've struggled with finding mental health resources in Marin County and want to put them all in one place. If you know of a resource that I should add, email me: [roshkins@gmail.com](mailto:roshkins@gmail.com). You can also issue a pull request if you know what that is or what that means.

## Mental Health Board

The Marin Mental Health Board meets the second Tuesday of every month at [20 North San Pedro Road, San Rafael, California](https://www.google.com/maps/place/20+N+San+Pedro+Rd,+San+Rafael,+CA+94903/@37.9947628,-122.5310837,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808599da7918cee7:0xa75611ff744abf91!8m2!3d37.994795!4d-122.529061). I am currently chair. Please email me, [roshkins@gmail.com](mailto:roshkins@gmail.com), if you have any questions or concerns about when or where the board meets.

 The board is currently off for **August**. The next meeting will be: **September 12, 2017**.

 The board is currently looking for new members! I encourage you to apply if you have ever used mental health services, you are a family member of someone going through mental health issues. I also would like to see mental health professionals, such as psychotherapists or psychiatrists, and interested members of the public, but these are not as much as a priority.
